## Future Implementation:

### Rolling Code as Security:

•A security measure in wireless communication where the code changes with each transmission to prevent reuse.
•Prevents replay attacks, ensures unpredictability, and maintains synchronization between transmitter and receiver.

### Night Vision & Advanced Target Identification:

•Use IR cameras or thermal imaging to operate in low-light conditions.
•Employ machine learning algorithms for better target classification.
•Integrate multi-sensor data for improved accuracy.
	
### Enhanced Communication Protocols:

•Use encryption and redundant communication channels for secure and reliable data transmission.
	
### Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) System:

•Incorporate an ABM system to detect and intercept ballistic missiles, providing an additional layer of defense.
•Use advanced radar and tracking systems to identify and neutralize threats at longer ranges.
	
### Manual Override:

•Introduce a manual override feature to allow human operators to take control of the turret in critical situations.
•Ensure the system can seamlessly switch between automated and manual modes to enhance operational flexibility.
	
These enhancements will make the turret system more robust, secure, and versatile in various operational environments.
